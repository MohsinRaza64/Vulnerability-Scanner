The Application Vulnerability Tracker is a tool designed to help users identify and manage software vulnerabilities on their systems. It provides an organized display of all installed applications, showing product names and versions to allow users to easily manage their software inventory.

Using the NIST CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) databases, the app scans installed software for known vulnerabilities. It gives detailed descriptions of vulnerabilities along with possible mitigations.
